# Traffic Scenarios of CommonRoad

This repository contains all scenarios of the [CommonRoad benchmarks](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/). The scenarios are either obtained from real traffic data ([NGSIM dataset](https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/trafficanalysistools/ngsim.htm)) or hand-crafted (mostly based on real road networks).

The scenarios are stored in xml files, which are defined as described in the documentation. 
Visualizations of the scenarios are provided at [https://commonroad.in.tum.de/scenarios/](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/scenarios/).

## Contribute

If you want to contribute new scenarios, you can simply create a merge request or contact us per [e-mail](mailto:commonroad-i06@in.tum.de).
